<h2>Digital Book Cover - Using Gimp</h2><br>
<p>Travel is a passion of mine. Throughout my travels I have enjoyed taking photos of all sorts of flora. Thus, when brainstorming ideas for a book cover, I explored my photo album and found high-resolution nature pics from a 2019 trip to Cambridge, England. 
I worked in GIMP, which is a cross-platform image editor, and started by selecting two close-up images of flowers and two close-up images of greenery to arrange in a symmetrical checkerboard pattern for the book cover. I liked the rich saturation and how the various plant textures complemented one another. The hues of green are also a close complement to the hues of purple and red-violet.  I added a semi-translucent, low-value purple overlay to bring uniformity, and used other values of purple for the centered shapes that house the book title so that the green did not overpower. Underneath the purple emblem (rectangle and oval), I created a stone texture layer to bring some dimensionality and interest to the title display. All in all, I hope that the rich and vivant colors and textures inspire the reader to go on a visual tour of Cambridge's natural wonders! </p>

<h2>Logo - Using Inkscape</h2><br>
<p>I decided to continue with the nature theme when creating my logo. Ever since we went into the 2020 COVID quarantine, I worked on developing my “green thumb” by cultivating a small plant family. While I still unintentionally kill plants on occasion, that hasn't stopped me from buying more! So, my logo would be the name of a plant store: “Bloom and Grow.” Since logos have more impact when they are memorable, the name for my plant store is actually a line from the “Edelweiss” song in The Sound of Music. I used Inkscape as my design tool and began by selecting my font. The “Noteworthy” font is a light-hearted and simple script with fluid and soft curves like those of a plant or flower. The font's high saturation green and fuschia are complementary colors that capture your attention. Furthermore, I chose to use the ampersand (&) symbol instead of "and" because I could embellish it like a flower, in hopes of inspring the viewer to purchase at the Bloom & Grow store. To create the flower, I first started with the “&” symbol. Next, I added a new layer where I used the freehand draw tool to enhance the stem. Last, I employed the stars and polygons tool to design the flower petals and the pistil.   <br>
