<h2>Quiz - HTML &amp; JavaScript</h2><br>
<p>For this project, I used Visual Studio to edit the HTML and JavaScript for my quiz that highlights civil rights moments in Gainesville's history. First, I copied and pasted the quiz code into my “index.html” file and changed the title wording to “Gainesville Social Justice History.” Next, I went to the body code and inserted a new background color: #ff6347, which is a tomato red. I added some spacing between the title, text box, solution & response lines by inserting breaks in between the specific codes. 
    Also, I enlarged my quiz title “Gainesville Social Justice History” by adding a heading code with a 50px font size. I kept saving the “index.html” file and testing it as I made changes, which was helpful. Then, I worked on the downloaded “popsolution.js” file in Visual Studio. To begin, I replaced the first 5 questions and answer choices with new ones I had created about Gainesville's social justice history, making sure to keep the same code format. Within the JavaScript file, I added 5 more questions and answer choices, following the same JavaScript coding. I revised the solutions to include the answer to all 10 questions, changed the var total=10, and customized some of the response compliments. To publish my quiz, I created a GitHub account and created a repository with my 2 project files. </p>

<h2>Drag-n-Drop Assessment - HTML &amp; CSS</h2><br>
<p>I chose “Art Movements” for this drag-and-drop activity. As a lover of art history, I thought it would be entertaining to have the user select characteristics and pieces of art that relate to specific art movements. I used Visual Studio again to revise the original html and css files and create my drag-and-drop. In the HTML code, I revised the title of the webpage and the answer boxes according to my Art Movement topic, and added one more answer box: Pop Art. Next, I revised the answers to coordinate with the answer boxes (either Neoclassicism, Baroque, Impressionism, and Pop Art) and added 3 answer choices for the Pop Art box. In the CSS file, I changed the webpage background color and the header background for the sorting boxes to a beautiful blue-violet gradient. To do this, I visited the “CSS Gradient” website to create my gradient and then copied the CSS code into certain sections of the CSS file. In terms of fonts, I chose the Verdana font family because sans serif fonts are easier to read. Using the color swatches from the “CSS Gradient” website, I also revised the font color for my main text and title to #3F00FF (a beautiful indigo), and updated the color of the “correctAnswer” and “wrongAnswer” backgrounds to be more muted and better match with the overall color scheme. Then, I widened the main container to 1000px and minimized the height to 340px to better fit all 4 sorting boxes, and minimized the height of the “list of items” container to 290px so that its border would fit inside the main container. Since my descriptors were longer than the space provided in the boxes, I minimized the font from 13px to 12px, widened the “List of Items” column to 200px, and widened the other 4 columns to 180px. Last, I uploaded the files to my new “drag-drop” repository on GitHub and published it. </p>
