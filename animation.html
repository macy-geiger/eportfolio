		<h2>What is Gravity Video</h2><br>
		<p>For this project, I used Adobe Animate. First, I completed a few of the practice animation tutorials offered with the program, which were quite helpful in providing more of a hands-on learning experience. Once I began my new animation, I selected a static nature background from the assets menu as my first layer. Next, with the brush tool, I drew an apple and duplicated my image to place them on the tree. I locked the apples and background image layer so that they would remain static. Then I added a new layer with just one apple: this would be the gravity apple that would fall down. My last layer was the old man who I added from the assets menu. With the asset warp tool, I connected the segments of his body that I later manipulated with the new keyframes so that he could react to the apple hitting his head. In between each new keyframe, I inserted a classic tween to connect the movements. I exported my animation video from Adobe Animate and uploaded it into Screencast-o-Matic, the video editing program I used for last week's project. To make the video longer than 3 seconds, I copied the file and added an introduction slide and a transition in between the looping. I also added some text and an arrow to reinforce that the apple falling was an example of gravity. Last, I added a brief narration, saved the video file, and uploaded it to YouTube.</p></div>
